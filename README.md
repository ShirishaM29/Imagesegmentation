Image Analysis and Processing with Python
This repository contains Python scripts for performing image analysis and processing tasks using OpenCV, scikit-image, and other libraries.

The scripts demonstrate techniques such as color segmentation, morphological operations, connected component labeling, and region properties analysis. 

These tools are useful for extracting meaningful information from images and performing automated visual inspections or measurements.

Key Features:
Color Segmentation: Segmenting images based on color ranges in HSV color space.

Morphological Operations: Improving segmentation masks using operations like closing and opening.

Connected Component Labeling: Identifying and labeling distinct regions in segmented images.

Region Properties: Computing properties such as area, diameter, mean intensity, and solidity of labeled regions.

Visualization: Displaying original images, segmentation masks, labeled images, and overlays for visual analysis.


Example Applications:
Identifying and counting specific objects in an image based on color criteria.

Analyzing the size and distribution of particles or objects in microscopy or industrial inspection.

Automating quality control processes by detecting defects or anomalies in products.


Usage:
Explore the provided scripts to understand how to apply these techniques to your own images. 

The repository also includes examples of integrating image analysis results into data structures like pandas DataFrames for further processing or reporting.

Dependencies:

Python 3.x

OpenCV

scikit-image

Matplotlib

NumPy

pandas


Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.
Suggestions for new features or optimizations are appreciated to enhance the capabilities of image analysis and processing workflows.
